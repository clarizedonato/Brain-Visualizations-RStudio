## Brain Visualizations in Rstudio
This code is used to overlay two different gradients onto the same brain map visual. This code is helpful if you want to overlay 2 different gradients (for example, you want to show non-significant and significant p-values of specific brain regions onto the same brain map). 

This is an example of a brain map visual that is generated using the code.
